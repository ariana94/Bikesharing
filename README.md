Kate suggests that you use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for your analysis. You agree, but then remind her that you must be cautious when looking at the data, as it applies specifically to New York Cityâ€”Des Moines is quite different!

You're excited to find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines, drawing on both your data expertise and critical thinking skills. You'll also need to rely on Kate's salesmanship during the investor conversations. Kate can sell almost anything, but it's up to you to make sure she's selling something viable.

After thinking through various questions, you settle on the first question you would like the data to answer: how many bike trips were recorded during the month of August? Since August is a beautiful time of the year to rent a bike, we want to use this data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.
