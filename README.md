Kate suggests that you use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for your analysis. You agree, but then remind her that you must be cautious when looking at the data, as it applies specifically to New York Cityâ€”Des Moines is quite different!

You're excited to find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines, drawing on both your data expertise and critical thinking skills. You'll also need to rely on Kate's salesmanship during the investor conversations. Kate can sell almost anything, but it's up to you to make sure she's selling something viable.
