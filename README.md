# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike

In this analysis, I used CitiBike data for August of 2019 that was released to the public. I chose to use August because it is a beautiful time of the year in New York City to rent a bike. My friend Kate and I want to use this data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines. Tableau was utilized to show the data in a way that is easy to understand.

## Ride into the data

Through analyzing this bike share data, we will be able to answer the following questions:
- Who uses bikeshare programs?
- What areas of a city see the most bikeshare usage?
- What times are bikes used the most and the least?
- How many times are the bikes used?


### Who uses bikeshare programs?

In this pie chart, we can see how many of our customers are subscribers as well as their gender.


### What areas of a city see the most bikeshare usage?

In this close up of New York City, we can see that the commerical areas, such as Manhattan, are getting the highest number of rides. The surrounding areas are neighborhoods with some activity, but not nearly as much as the commercial areas.

### What times are bikes used the most and the least?
This is crucial information for us to know so that maintenance can be arranged at a time where it will have the least affect on business. This heatmap shows that on all the weekdays, 1AM to 4AM is a very quiet time for usage. Between these hours would be the best for maintenance.

### How many times are the bikes used?

We have already figured out that the bikes in the commercial areas are used the most, by pinpointing the usage to each bikes individual ID, we are able to see what bikes have the most usage and will require maintenance more often.

## Cruising into more info
If we take a closer look at this data, we can see that the bikesharing program is more popular among males who are also subscribers.

Male customers check out more bikes, but around the same time frames as our female and unknown customers.

We can also see that regardless of gender, users tend to use the bike for a short amount of time, generally less than an hour.

## The End of the Road
In short, bikesharing would show success in the city of Des Moines
